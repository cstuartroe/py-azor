# py-azor

This is a re-implementation of the 
[Azor programming language](https://github.com/cstuartroe/azor).
I'm reimplementing it in steps to accompany
[my YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpaq9LamQHUkHR8AbRtS_QFuL89-b-B-Y)
on building an interpreter from scratch in Python.

## Requirements

`py-azor` requires no Python libraries. The only requirement is that you use Python >= 3.6, but hey, if you weren't already doing that
you were basically living in the Dark Ages.

## Usage

`python azor.py path/to/something.azor`

Not sure what file to run? Try

`python azor.py test.azor`
